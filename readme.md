LoathebOrder
===
Provides a macro to announce your Loatheb heal and who is next up.  
---
Type or macro `/loathebhealed` to announce yourself after/during a heal.  
Replaces macros like: `/y Ehawne has Healed >>> Ferroklast Next`  
___
Raid officers should use some variation of the following announce form in `/ra` or `/rw`:  
`Loatheb order: HealerOne > HealerTwo > HealerThree > HealerFour`  
In particular it's looking for a line that has `loatheb` somewhere in it and uses `>` to separate/order healer names.
